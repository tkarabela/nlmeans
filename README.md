# Non-Local Means Denoiser (OpenCL)

Quick port of my school project from CUDA to OpenCL. For information about the algorithm, see [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-local_means) or [[2]](http://bengal.missouri.edu/~kes25c/).

This repo includes Qt-based GUI for interactive parameter tuning and IPython Notebook for development.

Requirements:

- Python 3
- PyQt4
- NumPy
- PIL (Pillow)
- PyOpenCL + OpenCL drivers
